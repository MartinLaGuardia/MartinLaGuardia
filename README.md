I am a junior web developer with sales skills and creative communication tools that come from a past as Creative Director of DDBÂº advertising, an agency belonging to the Omnicom group and 4 years as a radio broadcaster in a humorous program. 

I've recently finished a Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack, now I'm developing projects personally and open to new job opportunities.
